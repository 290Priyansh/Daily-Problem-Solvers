# 🧪 Periodic Table Web App

An interactive and intuitive **Modern Periodic Table** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created with a personal motivation — to help my younger brother **learn and understand the periodic table** in a more **engaging and visually appealing way**. Traditional static tables in textbooks can feel dry or overwhelming, so this tool aims to make chemistry more **fun**, **interactive**, and **approachable**.

## 🌟 Features

* ✅ Clean, responsive UI layout of the modern periodic table
* 🧠 Hover-based element info preview
* 🔍 Click any element to view **detailed atomic information**
* 🎨 Color-coded categories for better understanding of element groups
* 📱 Mobile-friendly and works across devices

   git clone https://github.com/VipranshOjha/Periodic-Table.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser
